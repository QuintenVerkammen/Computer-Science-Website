            <p>Here are our three favourite Movies!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lotr">
            <h3>
                Lord of the Rings: Return of the King
            </h3>
            <p><img src="images/lotr.jpg" height="240"/>Jackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the
                traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more
                affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some
                cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's Scouring
                of The Shire). But those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve
                the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll.
                Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.

            <h3>
                Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2
            </h3>
            <p>
                <img src="images/harrypotter.jpg" width="300"/>"It all ends," says the poster slogan. A potentially grim statement
                of the obvious, of course, yet the Potter saga could hardly have ended on a better note. With one miraculous
                flourish of its wand, the franchise has restored the essential magic to the Potter legend – which had been
                starting to sag and drift in recent movies – zapping us all with a cracking final chapter. It's dramatically
                satisfying, spectacular and terrifically exciting, easily justifying the decision to split the last book into two.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rotj">
            <h3>
                Star Wars: Return of the Jedi
            </h3>
            <p>
                <img src="images/rotj.jpg" height="150"/>With this last of the central “Star Wars” cycle, there is the sense of the
                closing of a circle, of leaving behind real friends. It is accomplished with a weight and a new maturity that seem
                entirely fitting, yet the movie has lost none of its sense of fun; it bursts with new inventiveness. With “Jedi,”
                George Lucas may have pulled off the first triple crown of motion pictures. It is a very deep and compelling movie,
                with a satisfying plot and ending, not to mention a stunning soundtrack.
