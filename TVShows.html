                <p><img src="images/friends.png"width="300"/>There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the
                    singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes in
                    such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk
                    about in coffee shops too. The humor is universal. The viewer feels like they're part of the group every time
                    they watch it because they feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun
                    because it's fast-paced. Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't
                    feel like it is dragging you onto nothing. Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny!

                <h3>
                    The Office (US)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/theoffice.jpg" width="300"/>Several great sitcoms in similar formats have aired since 2005, but
                    few have reached the creative heights The Office once did. During those early seasons, the show's creators penned
                    compelling tales about how a performance review session can cause part of the soul to die, and maximized the humor
                    and storytelling of every frame and well-timed reaction shot. So even though its later seasons never lived up to
                    its groundbreaking early explorations of contemporary work culture, what The Office leaves us with are memories of
                    television comedy at its best.

                    <img src="images/brooklyn99.jpg" width="300"/>Once any show gets past a certain number of seasons or episodes,
                    quality is always a concern. In comedies, this is especially an issue when it comes to characterization.
                    Characters become their catchphrases or their quirks, with no nuance or personality outside of that. Seven
                    seasons in, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is at a high risk of that happening; and the way Season Six had to
                    function as Brooklyn Nine-Nine 101, the show could’ve fallen right into that trap and possibly remained there
                    heading into this season. Three episodes into Season Seven, the writers seem determined to prove that they still
                    have quite a bit of story to tell with these characters. They’re doing a good job so far.
