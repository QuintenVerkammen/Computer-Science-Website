                <h2>Our three favourite Streaming Platforms</h2>
                <p>Here are our three favourite Streaming Platforms to watch and enjoy countless exciting TV-Shows and Movies!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="netflix">
                <h3>
                    Netflix
                </h3>
                <p><img src="images/netflix.jpeg"width="300"/>Netflix stocks an enormous array of quirky and quality TV shows,
                    cult hits, family favorites, and trendy original programming. It also offers offline downloads for mobile
                    devices, ad-free streams across all tiers, and convenient features such as Smart Downloads. However, its price
                    has crept up over the years and the launch of high-quality streaming alternatives at significantly lower monthly
                    costs means that it is no longer as good a value. We still give it an Editors' Choice for on-demand video
                    streaming given its excellent original content and vast library. If you are looking for true cable replacements,
                    try Hulu's Live TV option or YouTube TV.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="disney">
                <h3>
                    Disney+
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/disneyplus.jpg" width="300"/>Disney+ is a formidable video streaming competitor
                    at launch, since it leverages Disney's vast catalog of entertainment content and promises new originals in
                    popular franchises. We also appreciate its family-friendly features (four simultaneous streams and seven user
                    profiles), sleek interfaces, ad-free experience, and offline download capabilities. However, for the service
                    to earn a higher rating, Disney+'s currently announced and upcoming originals need to succeed; it's too early
                    on for us to judge their quality. We would also like Disney to integrate more properties from its 21st Century
                    Fox acquisition. Netflix remains our Editors' Choice for on-demand video streaming for its excellent interface,
                    features, and originals. Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TV are our picks for the best live TV services, respectively,
                    for their value and channel lineup.

            <div class="hulu">
                <h3>
                    Hulu
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="images/hulu.jpg" width="300"/>If you're getting only one streaming service, Hulu is an excellent
                    choice for its combination of on-demand content and live TV, even if its original shows are mostly lackluster.
                    On the technical side, Hulu's offline downloads are restricted to higher-tier plans and it still lacks
                    substantial 4K content. Netflix offers a better selection of on-demand shows and YouTube TV features better
                    live TV coverage, but Hulu's combination of both content types makes it an Editors' Choice pick alongside
                    those services, despite its rising costs.
